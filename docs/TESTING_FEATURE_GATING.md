# Testing Feature Gating Components

**Status:** Components created, ready for integration testing
**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

## What You Need to Test

### Quick Answer:
**Nothing yet!** The components are created but not integrated into any pages yet.

**Next:** I'll integrate them into the Research Hub page, then you can test the full flow.

---

## Once Integrated, You'll Test:

### Test 1: Pro Badge Visibility (Free Account)
**Page:** `/research` (Research Hub)

**Expected:**
- Survey Analysis should show gold "PRO" badge
- Review Mining should show gold "PRO" badge
- Heatmap Analysis should show gold "PRO" badge
- User Testing should show gold "PRO" badge
- Page Analysis should NOT show badge (it's free)
- GA4 Analysis should NOT show badge (it's free)

**How to verify:**
1. Go to `/research`
2. Look for gold "PRO" badges on 4 out of 6 analysis types

---

### Test 2: Upgrade Modal (Free Account)
**Page:** `/research` (Research Hub)

**Expected:**
When you click on a premium feature (e.g., Survey Analysis):
- Modal should appear with:
  - Feature name in title
  - "This feature requires Pro" message
  - List of Pro benefits
  - Pricing: $49/month
  - Two buttons: "View Plans" and "Upgrade Now"
- Both buttons should take you to `/settings/billing`
- Close button (X) should dismiss modal

**How to verify:**
1. Click on "Survey Analysis" card
2. Verify modal appears
3. Click "Upgrade Now" → Should go to billing page
4. Go back, click "Survey Analysis" again
5. Click X to close → Modal disappears

---

### Test 3: Usage Limit Banner (Free Account with 4/5 analyses)
**Page:** `/research` (Research Hub)

**Expected:**
- At 4/5 analyses (80%) → Yellow info banner appears
  - Message: "You've used 4 of 5 analyses this month"
  - "Upgrade to Pro for 10x more" link
- At 5/5 analyses (100%) → Red warning banner appears
  - Message: "Analyses Limit Reached"
  - "Upgrade to Pro" button
  - More prominent styling

**How to verify:**
1. Create 4 page analyses
2. Go to `/research`
3. Yellow banner should appear at top
4. Create 5th analysis
5. Go to `/research`
6. Red banner should appear

---

### Test 4: No Badges or Limits (Pro Account)
**Page:** `/research` (Research Hub)

**Expected:**
- NO Pro badges on any features (all unlocked)
- NO usage limit banner (even at high usage)
- All analysis types clickable
- No upgrade modals

**How to verify:**
1. Upgrade to Pro (test mode)
2. Go to `/research`
3. No Pro badges visible
4. All features accessible

---

## Component Testing (Isolated)

If you want to test components in isolation before integration:

### UpgradeModal Test Page
Create a test page: `app/test/upgrade-modal/page.tsx`

```tsx
'use client';
import { useState } from 'react';
import UpgradeModal from '@/components/UpgradeModal';

export default function TestPage() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="p-8">
      <button
        onClick={() => setOpen(true)}
        className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
      >
        Open Modal
      </button>

      <UpgradeModal
        open={open}
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        feature="Survey Analysis"
        limitType="feature"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Test:**
1. Go to `/test/upgrade-modal`
2. Click button
3. Modal should appear

### ProBadge Test
Add to same test page:

```tsx
import ProBadge from '@/components/ProBadge';

// In render:
<div className="space-y-4">
  <ProBadge size="sm" />
  <ProBadge size="md" />
  <ProBadge size="lg" />
  <ProBadge size="md" tooltip />
</div>
```

**Test:**
1. Should see 4 badges
2. Hover last one → tooltip appears

### UsageLimitBanner Test
Add to test page:

```tsx
import UsageLimitBanner from '@/components/UsageLimitBanner';

// In render:
<div className="space-y-4">
  <UsageLimitBanner
    resourceType="analyses"
    current={4}
    limit={5}
  />
  <UsageLimitBanner
    resourceType="analyses"
    current={5}
    limit={5}
  />
</div>
```

**Test:**
1. Should see yellow banner (4/5)
2. Should see red banner (5/5)

---

## Current Status

**What's Done:**
- ✅ UpgradeModal component created
- ✅ ProBadge component created
- ✅ UsageLimitBanner component created
- ✅ Components committed and pushed

**What's Next:**
- ⏳ Integrate into `/research` page
- ⏳ Add subscription check logic
- ⏳ Test with Free account
- ⏳ Test with Pro account

---

## My Recommendation

**Don't test yet.** Wait for me to:
1. Integrate the components into the Research Hub
2. Add the subscription checking logic
3. Wire up the click handlers

Then you can test the **complete user flow** which is much more meaningful than testing isolated components.

**ETA:** 10-15 minutes to integrate everything, then you can test the full experience.

## After Integration, Your Test Checklist:

### As a Free User:
- [ ] See Pro badges on 4 premium features
- [ ] Click premium feature → Modal appears
- [ ] Modal shows correct feature name

- [ ] Create 5th analysis → Red banner appears

### As a Pro User:
- [ ] No Pro badges visible
- [ ] All features clickable (no modals)
- [ ] No usage banners (even at high usage)

**Time needed:** ~5 minutes per test scenario
