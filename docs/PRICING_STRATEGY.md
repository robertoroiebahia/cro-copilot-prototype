## Usage Tracking Logic

### What Counts as "Usage"?

**Analyses:**
- Creating a new page analysis (screenshot-based)
- Running a GA4 analysis
- Uploading CSV for review mining
- Uploading CSV for survey analysis
- Uploading CSV for on-site poll analysis
- Each analysis type counts as 1 analysis

**Insights:**
- FREE tier: Can view up to 50 insights total (across all analyses)
- PRO tier: Unlimited viewing, unlimited manual creation
- Insights generated by AI don't count separately (they're part of the analysis)

**Experiments:**
- Creating a new experiment counts toward monthly limit
- FREE tier: Max 2 active experiments
- PRO tier: Max 25 experiments per month

**Workspaces:**
- Hard limit based on tier
- Cannot create more workspaces than allowed
- Archiving a workspace doesn't free up the slot
