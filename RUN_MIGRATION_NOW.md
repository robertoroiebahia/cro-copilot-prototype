# üöÄ Run Migration NOW - Copy/Paste Guide

**‚úÖ API Route Already Updated!**

I've already updated `/app/api/analyze-v2/route.ts` for you with:
- ‚úÖ Workspace validation
- ‚úÖ workspace_id in database inserts
- ‚úÖ Security checks

**Now let's run the database migration!**

---

## Step 1: Get Your Database URL

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click: **Project Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
4. Click: **Database** (in left sidebar)
5. Scroll to: **Connection string**
6. Select: **URI** tab
7. **Copy** the connection string
8. **Replace** `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual password

It looks like:
```
postgresql://postgres.xxxxx:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

---

## Step 2: Run These Commands

Open your terminal and paste these commands **one at a time**:

### A. Set Database URL

```bash
# Replace with YOUR connection string (with real password)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.xxxxx:YOUR_PASSWORD@xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

### B. Navigate to Project

```bash
cd /Users/robertobahia/Projects/cro-copilot-prototype
```

### C. Create Backup (CRITICAL!)

```bash
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > backup_before_workspace_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify it was created
ls -lh backup_before_workspace_*.sql
```

**‚úÖ You should see a file with size > 0 bytes**

### D. Check Current State

```bash
# Should return 0 (no workspace_id columns yet)
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE column_name = 'workspace_id'
AND table_schema = 'public';
"
```

### E. Run Migration! üöÄ

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/011_add_workspace_id_to_all_tables.sql
```

**Watch for:** "Migration 011 completed successfully" at the end

### F. Verify It Worked

```bash
# Should return 5 (workspace_id in 5 tables)
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT table_name, column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE column_name = 'workspace_id'
AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
"
```

**‚úÖ Expected output:** 5 rows showing:
- analyses
- experiments
- hypotheses
- insights
- themes

### G. Check Data Migration

```bash
# All counts should match (no NULLs)
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT 'analyses' as table_name, COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(workspace_id) as with_workspace
FROM analyses
UNION ALL
SELECT 'insights', COUNT(*), COUNT(workspace_id) FROM insights
UNION ALL
SELECT 'themes', COUNT(*), COUNT(workspace_id) FROM themes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'hypotheses', COUNT(*), COUNT(workspace_id) FROM hypotheses
UNION ALL
SELECT 'experiments', COUNT(*), COUNT(workspace_id) FROM experiments;
"
```

**‚úÖ Expected:** `total` = `with_workspace` for all rows

---

## Step 3: Deploy & Test

### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add workspace_id support to database and API

- Run migration 011 (adds workspace_id to all tables)
- Update analyze-v2 API route with workspace validation
- Add workspace context to analyses and insights

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push
```

### Test Your App

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment** (1-2 minutes)
2. **Open your app** in browser
3. **Log in**
4. **Select a workspace** from dropdown
5. **Try analyzing a page** (e.g., https://stripe.com)
6. **Check it succeeds** without errors

**‚úÖ Success criteria:**
- Analysis completes
- Results show up
- No console errors
- Can view in "All Analyses"

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Migration Fails?

**Read the error carefully**, then:

```bash
# Rollback
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/011_add_workspace_id_to_all_tables_ROLLBACK.sql

# Share the error with me, we'll debug together
```

### App Still Crashes?

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Check Vercel logs**: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs
3. **Verify workspace_id columns exist**:
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'workspace_id';"
   ```
4. **Share the error** and we'll fix it

### "Cannot connect to database"?

- Check your DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check password is correct (no `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` placeholder)
- Check you can ping the database:
  ```bash
  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"
  ```

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

After running all steps, verify:

- [ ] Backup file created and has content
- [ ] Migration ran without errors
- [ ] 5 tables now have workspace_id column
- [ ] All existing data has workspace_id populated
- [ ] Default workspaces created
- [ ] Code committed and pushed
- [ ] Vercel deployment succeeded
- [ ] Can log in to app
- [ ] Can analyze a page
- [ ] No errors in console

**All checked?** üéâ **You're done!** Your app is now working with workspace support!

---

## üìä What We Fixed

**Before:**
- ‚ùå Database missing workspace_id columns
- ‚ùå App crashed when analyzing
- ‚ùå Frontend queries failed
- ‚ùå Security vulnerability (no workspace validation)

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Database has workspace_id in all tables
- ‚úÖ App works correctly
- ‚úÖ Frontend queries succeed
- ‚úÖ Workspace isolation enforced
- ‚úÖ Security validated in API routes

---

## üéØ Next Steps (After This Works)

Once this is working, you should:

1. **Fix N+1 queries** (30 min) - See `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ROADMAP.md`
2. **Update other API routes** (2 hours) - See `API_ROUTES_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`
3. **Set up monitoring** (30 min) - Install Sentry
4. **Write tests** (2-3 hours) - Test workspace isolation

**Full plan:** `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ROADMAP.md`

## üí° Pro Tips

**Testing locally first:**
If you want to test on a development database first:
1. Create a second Supabase project for "dev"
2. Run migration there first
3. Test everything
4. Then run on production

**Monitoring the migration:**
Open a second terminal and watch logs:
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# Logs ‚Üí Select your project ‚Üí Watch in real-time
```

**If you're nervous:**
That's normal! The backup protects you. Worst case, you restore from backup and try again.

---

## üé¨ Ready?

**Start with Step 1** - Get your database URL from Supabase Dashboard.

Then run the commands one by one, verifying each step.

**Total time:** 15-20 minutes

Good luck! üöÄ
