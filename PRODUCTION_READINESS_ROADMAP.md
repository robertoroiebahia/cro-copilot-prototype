# 🚀 Production Readiness Roadmap

**Current Status:** NOT Production Ready
**Time to MVP:** 4-6 weeks
**Time to Professional Launch:** 8-12 weeks

---

## 🔥 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before ANY Launch)

### Issue #1: Database Schema Mismatch ⚠️ BLOCKING

**Status:** Migration created, ready to execute
**Priority:** P0 - App currently broken
**Timeline:** This week

**Problem:**
- Frontend queries use `workspace_id` column
- Database doesn't have `workspace_id` column
- App will crash when users try to analyze pages

**Solution:**
✅ Migration created: `011_add_workspace_id_to_all_tables.sql`
✅ Rollback script created
✅ Execution plan created

**Next Steps:**
1. Review: `WORKSPACE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
2. Execute migration in development
3. Update API routes (see `API_ROUTES_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`)
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy to production

---

### Issue #2: API Security Vulnerabilities ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Status:** Fix ready to implement
**Priority:** P0 - Security risk
**Timeline:** This week

**Problem:**
- API routes don't validate workspace ownership
- Potential for unauthorized access to other users' data
- Missing workspace_id in database operations

**Solution:**
✅ Workspace validation utility created: `lib/utils/workspace-validation.ts`
✅ API update guide created: `API_ROUTES_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`

**Routes to Update:**
- [ ] `/app/api/analyze-v2/route.ts` ← Start here
- [ ] `/app/api/insights/[id]/route.ts`
- [ ] `/app/api/hypotheses/route.ts`
- [ ] `/app/api/themes/route.ts`
- [ ] `/app/api/experiments/route.ts`

---

### Issue #3: N+1 Query Performance Problem ⚠️ HIGH

**Status:** Fix needed
**Priority:** P1 - Performance degradation
**Timeline:** Next week

**Problem:**
```typescript
// In /app/analyses/page.tsx
const analysesWithCounts = await Promise.all(
  data.map(async (analysis) => {
    // Separate query for EACH analysis! 😱
    const { count } = await supabase.from('insights')...
  })
);
```

**Impact:** 100 analyses = 101 database queries (slow!)

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Use JOIN instead
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('analyses')
  .select(`
    *,
    insights_count:insights(count)
  `)
  .eq('workspace_id', selectedWorkspaceId);
```

**Files to Update:**
- `/app/analyses/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `/app/insights/page.tsx`
- Any other pages with similar patterns

## 🚨 Show Stoppers

**Don't launch until these are fixed:**

1. ❌ Database migration not run
   - App will crash immediately
   - Data will be lost

2. ❌ API routes not secured
   - Users could access other users' data
   - Major security breach

3. ❌ No error monitoring
   - You won't know when things break
   - Can't fix what you can't see

4. ❌ No backups
   - One bug = all data lost
   - Unacceptable risk

5. ❌ No rate limiting
   - DDoS attacks will take you down
   - API abuse will cost you money
