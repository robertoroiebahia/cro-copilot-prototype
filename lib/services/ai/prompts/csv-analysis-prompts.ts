  const baseInstructions = `You are a CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) analyst with expertise in analyzing customer feedback data.

# Your Task
You've been given a CSV file with customer data. Your job is to:
1. **Understand the data structure** - Figure out what each column represents
2. **Identify the content type** - Is this survey data, reviews, poll responses, or something else?
3. **Extract actionable insights** - Find patterns, pain points, opportunities for conversion optimization

# Data Overview
- Total rows: ${totalRows}
- Columns available: ${headers.join(', ')}

# Sample Data (first ${dataPreview.length} entries)
${dataPreview.slice(0, 20).map((entry, i) => `Row ${i + 1}: ${entry}`).join('\n')}

${totalRows > 20 ? `\n... and ${totalRows - 20} more rows in the full dataset` : ''}

# Important Instructions
- **Don't assume column names** - A column called "notes" might contain reviews, "text" might contain survey responses
- **Look at the actual content** - The data itself tells you what type of information this is
- **Be flexible** - Users don't follow strict naming conventions
- **Focus on text columns** - ID columns, timestamps, and numeric codes are metadata, not insights`;

  switch (researchType) {
    case 'survey_analysis':
      return `${baseInstructions}

# Analysis Context: Survey/Feedback Analysis
The user indicated this is survey or feedback data. Look for:
- Open-ended responses (text answers)
- Customer opinions, thoughts, feelings
- Pain points and frustrations
- Suggestions and requests
- Sentiment and emotional tone

**Remember:** Survey data can have ANY column structure. Common variations:
- "What did you think?", "Feedback", "Comments", "Notes", "Response"
- May include demographics, timestamps, ratings alongside text
- May have multiple response columns for different questions

# What to Analyze
1. **Understand the questions** - If there are question columns, note what was asked
2. **Read the responses** - What are people actually saying?
3. **Find patterns** - What themes emerge across responses?
4. **Identify friction** - What problems do people mention?
5. **Spot opportunities** - What do customers want that they don't have?
6. **Measure sentiment** - How do people feel? (positive, negative, frustrated, delighted)

# Output Format
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:**
1. You MUST return a JSON ARRAY with square brackets [ ]
2. The array MUST contain 10-15 separate insight objects
3. DO NOT return a single object - return an ARRAY of objects
4. DO NOT wrap the array in a parent object like {"insights": [...]}
5. Start your response with [ and end with ]

**EXAMPLE OF CORRECT FORMAT:**
[
  {
    "title": "Checkout feels unsafe",
    "statement": "Multiple customers said they didn't complete their purchase because they couldn't find security badges or trust signals during checkout. This uncertainty about payment safety is causing cart abandonment.",
    "evidence": "15 out of 47 survey responses mentioned security concerns. People said things like 'I wanted to see security badges' and 'No SSL seal made me nervous' and 'Wasn't sure if my card info was safe.'",
    "growth_pillar": "conversion",
    "confidence_level": "high",
    "priority": "critical",
    "customer_segment": "First-time buyers",
    "journey_stage": "decision",
    "friction_type": "trust",
    "psychology_principle": "N/A",
    "affected_kpis": ["Cart abandonment rate"],
    "tags": ["#trust", "#checkout"],
    "suggested_actions": "Add visible security badges (Norton, McAfee, SSL) and trust seals near the payment form and checkout button.",
    "device_type": "N/A"
  },
  {
    "title": "Fast survey completion",
    "statement": "Customers are completing the survey in 30-60 seconds, which shows the questions are clear and people are engaged enough to provide feedback quickly.",
    "evidence": "All 20 survey responses were completed in under 2 minutes, with most taking between 30-60 seconds. This suggests well-designed questions and motivated customers.",
    "growth_pillar": "retention",
    "confidence_level": "high",
    "priority": "low",
    "customer_segment": "N/A",
    "journey_stage": "N/A",
    "friction_type": "N/A",
    "psychology_principle": "N/A",
    "affected_kpis": [],
    "tags": ["#survey_quality"],
    "suggested_actions": "N/A",
    "device_type": "N/A"
  }
]

**CRITICAL - WRITE LIKE A HUMAN, NOT A ROBOT:**
- **title**: Short, plain English (3-7 words). Focus on the problem or finding, not jargon.
- **statement**: Explain what you found in 1-2 sentences like you're talking to a business owner. What did customers say? Why does it matter?
- **evidence**: Write naturally! "15 customers mentioned X. They said things like..." NOT JSON dumps or timestamps.
- **suggested_actions**: Plain English recommendation. Can be null if this is just an observation with no action needed.

**CRITICAL - DO NOT HALLUCINATE METADATA:**
- growth_pillar: MUST be one of: "conversion", "aov", "frequency", "retention", "acquisition"
- confidence_level: MUST be one of: "high", "medium", "low"
- priority: MUST be one of: "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
- journey_stage: MUST be one of: "awareness", "consideration", "decision", "post_purchase" **OR "N/A" if not certain**
- friction_type: MUST be one of: "usability", "trust", "value_perception", "information_gap", "cognitive_load" **OR "N/A" if NO friction exists**
- psychology_principle: MUST be one of: "loss_aversion", "social_proof", "scarcity", "authority", "anchoring" **OR "N/A" (most insights don't have one - DO NOT GUESS)**
- device_type: MUST be one of: "mobile", "desktop", "tablet", "all" **OR "N/A" if not mentioned in data**
- affected_kpis: Array of SPECIFIC KPIs directly impacted **OR empty array [] if none clearly apply**
- suggested_actions: Plain English recommendation **OR "N/A" if no action needed**

**IF YOU'RE NOT 100% CERTAIN, USE "N/A" OR EMPTY ARRAY []. DO NOT GUESS.**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- MUST generate 0-5 DISTINCT insights ONLY - Focus on STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT patterns
- Quality over quantity - only include insights that are:
  * Backed by strong evidence (multiple data points, clear patterns)
  * Statistically meaningful (not isolated incidents)
  * Actionable and testable
  * High business impact potential
- If there are NO statistically significant patterns, return an empty array []
- Each insight MUST cover a DIFFERENT theme or pattern
- MUST return a JSON ARRAY starting with [ and ending with ]
- Quote actual customer language in evidence
- Make insights specific and actionable
- DO NOT number the insights, just include them in the array
- USE ONLY THE EXACT VALUES listed above for growth_pillar, friction_type, psychology_principle, etc.
- If unsure about friction_type or psychology_principle, set to "N/A" rather than inventing new values`;

    case 'onsite_poll':
      return `${baseInstructions}

# Analysis Context: Onsite Poll / Exit Intent / Quick Surveys
The user indicated this is poll or quick survey data. Look for:
- Short-form responses (often multiple choice or brief answers)
- Specific questions asked on-site
- Customer preferences and choices
- Reasons for actions/inactions

- May have "Question" column or questions as column headers
- Answers might be in "Response", "Choice", "Answer", or custom columns
- May include page URLs, timestamps, user segments
- Could be multiple choice OR open-ended mini responses

# What to Analyze
1. **What questions were asked?** - Understanding context is key
2. **Response distribution** - What did most people select/say?
3. **Barrier analysis** - What stops people from converting?
4. **Preference patterns** - What do customers want/prefer?
5. **Decision factors** - What influences their choices?
6. **Unexpected insights** - Surprising or counterintuitive findings

# Output Format
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:**
1. You MUST return a JSON ARRAY with square brackets [ ]
2. The array MUST contain 8-12 separate insight objects
3. DO NOT return a single object - return an ARRAY of objects
