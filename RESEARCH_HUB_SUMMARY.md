- Wrapped with `WorkspaceGuard` component
- Shows workspace name in header
- Fetches real-time analysis counts per methodology for selected workspace
- All navigation respects workspace context

---

## 📊 Data Flow

```typescript
1. User selects workspace → WorkspaceContext updates
2. Research Hub loads → Fetches analysis counts from DB
3. Stats display → Shows methodology usage for THIS workspace
4. User clicks methodology → Redirects to analyze page with workspace context
5. New analysis created → Associated with selected workspace automatically
```
