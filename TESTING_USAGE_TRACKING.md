# Testing Usage Tracking - RLS Fix Applied ‚úÖ

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Fix Applied:** Migration 019 - Fixed RLS policies for usage_tracking table

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Complete

### RLS Policies Verified:
```
1. "Allow RPC function to insert usage" (INSERT) - WITH CHECK: true
2. "Allow RPC function to update usage" (UPDATE) - USING: true, WITH CHECK: true
3. "Users can view usage for their workspaces" (SELECT) - Restricted to user's workspaces
```

### RPC Function Verified:
- `increment_usage()` has SECURITY DEFINER enabled ‚úÖ
- Can bypass RLS to perform INSERT/UPDATE operations ‚úÖ

### Current State:
- **Account:** rob@app.com (Free)
- **User ID:** 378228a0-54ab-4d63-9dbb-781e33ecd937
- **Workspace ID:** 682ad780-98df-4d3f-832b-6cf60bf2b185
- **Current Usage Records:** 0 (clean slate)

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Usage Page (Before)
1. Go to `/settings/usage`
2. Should show:
   - Analyses: 0/5
   - Insights: 0/50
   - All other metrics at 0

### Step 2: Create Test Analysis
1. Go to `/analyze`
2. Enter URL: `https://www.example.com`
3. Click "Analyze"
4. Wait for completion

### Step 3: Check Terminal Logs
Watch for these logs in your terminal:

**Expected Success Pattern:**
```
üîµ trackResourceCreation called: {
  userId: '378228a0-54ab-4d63-9dbb-781e33ecd937',
  workspaceId: '682ad780-98df-4d3f-832b-6cf60bf2b185',
  resourceType: 'analyses',
  researchType: 'page_analysis',
  timestamp: '...'
}
‚úÖ Successfully tracked analyses creation
‚úÖ Successfully tracked insights creation (multiple times)
```

**Previous Error (Should NOT see this anymore):**
```
‚ùå Failed to track analyses creation: new row violates row-level security policy
```

### Step 4: Verify Database
After analysis completes, run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM usage_tracking
WHERE user_id = '378228a0-54ab-4d63-9dbb-781e33ecd937';
```

Should show:
- 1 record with analyses_count = 1
- insights_count = (number of insights generated)
- analyses_by_type: { page_analysis: 1 }

### Step 5: Check Usage Page (After)
1. Go to `/settings/usage`
2. Should now show:
   - Analyses: 1/5 (20% progress bar)
   - Insights: X/50 (where X = number of insights)
   - Progress bars should be visible and green

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All these must be true:**
1. No ‚ùå error logs in terminal
2. ‚úÖ success logs appear for both analyses and insights
3. Database record created in usage_tracking table
4. Usage page displays updated counts with progress bars
5. No RLS policy errors in terminal or browser console

---

## üêõ If Still Not Working

**Check:**
1. Terminal logs for any errors
2. Browser console (F12) for errors
3. Network tab: `/api/usage` response
4. Database: Verify record was created

**Share with me:**
1. Full terminal logs from the analysis
2. Screenshot of usage page
3. Browser console errors
4. Result of database query above

## üìä Expected Limits (Free Account)

- Analyses: 5 per month
- Insights: 50 total
- Themes: 10 total
- Hypotheses: 5 total
- Experiments: 2 per month

After 5 analyses, the 6th should be blocked with a limit message.
